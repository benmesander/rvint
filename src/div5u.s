# The following routines started with the Hacker's Delight 2nd edition
# Chapter 10 routines, but were extended to handle 64 bits which involved
# refining the series expansions and the correction steps. In some
# cases I managed to save an instruction or two in the correction step.

# routine: div5u
#
# Unsigned fast division by 5 without using M extension.
# This routine is 64-bit on 64-bit CPUs and 32-bit on 32-bit CPUs.
# It uses a series expansion algorithm to implement division.
# Suitable for use on RV32E architectures.
#
# input registers:
# a0 = unsigned dividend (32 or 64 bits)
#
# output registers:
# a0 = quotient (unsigned)
